# Usage
This is a project template for vue-cli. It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.

      $ npm install npm@latest -g
      $ npm install -g vue-cli
      $ vue init webpack my-project
      $ cd my-project
      $ npm install
      $ npm run dev
This will scaffold the project using the master branch. If you wish to use the latest version of the webpack template, do the following instead:

⚠️ The develop branch is not considered stable and can contain bugs or not build at all, so use at your own risk.

The development server will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.
